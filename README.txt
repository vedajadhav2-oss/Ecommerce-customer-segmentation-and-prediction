E-COMMERCE CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION & PREDICTION
END-TO-END DATA ANALYTICS & MACHINE LEARNING CAPSTONE PROJECT


PROJECT DESCRIPTION
-------------------
This project is an end-to-end e-commerce customer analytics capstone project that focuses on understanding customer behavior and delivering business-ready insights. The project follows a complete real-world analytics workflow starting from data understanding and preprocessing, advanced exploratory data analysis, customer segmentation using unsupervised learning, customer segment prediction using supervised and deep learning models, application development using Streamlit, and final insight presentation using Power BI dashboards and PPT. The solution is designed to simulate a production-grade analytics system.


DATA UNDERSTANDING
------------------
- Studied the structure and meaning of the e-commerce dataset
- Understood customer, transaction, and behavioral attributes
- Identified data quality issues and business relevance of features


DATA CLEANING & PREPROCESSING
-----------------------------
- Handled missing values and inconsistencies
- Removed duplicates and invalid records
- Performed data type corrections
- Applied scaling and normalization where required
- Prepared clean, analysis-ready data


EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)
-------------------------------
EDA was performed in three levels to deeply understand customer behavior:

1. Univariate Analysis
   - Distribution of individual variables
   - Outlier detection
   - Central tendency analysis

2. Bivariate Analysis
   - Relationship between customer features
   - Feature vs revenue analysis
   - Correlation analysis

3. Multivariate Analysis
   - Interaction between multiple variables
   - Customer behavior patterns
   - Feature combinations affecting customer value


CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION (UNSUPERVISED LEARNING)
---------------------------------------------
Customer segmentation was performed using multiple clustering algorithms:

1. K-Means Clustering
2. DBSCAN
3. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
4. Hierarchical Clustering

- Compared clustering results using evaluation metrics
- Selected the best clustering model based on comparison table
- Created meaningful customer segments
- Labeled clusters as High Value, Medium Value, and Low Value customers


FEATURE ENGINEERING & RFM ANALYSIS
----------------------------------
- Created customer-level aggregated features
- Generated RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) table
- Used RFM values to strengthen segmentation logic
- Helped in business interpretation of customer groups


TARGET VARIABLE CREATION
------------------------
- Converted clustering output into a target variable
- Assigned segment labels as supervised learning targets
- Prepared final dataset for predictive modeling


SUPERVISED & DEEP LEARNING MODELS
--------------------------------
The following models were trained and evaluated to predict customer segments:

Supervised Machine Learning Models:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree Classifier
3. Random Forest Classifier
4. Gradient Boosting Classifier

Deep Learning Model:
5. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

- Compared models using a performance comparison table
- Evaluated accuracy and consistency
- Finalized the best-performing supervised models
- Selected and froze the top 2 models for deployment


STREAMLIT APPLICATION
---------------------
A Streamlit-based analytics application was developed where:
- User provides customer inputs
- Trained models predict customer segment
- Predictions are displayed in real time
- Application simulates a real-world analytics product

The application represents the deployment layer of the project.


DASHBOARD & PRESENTATION LAYER
------------------------------
Power BI dashboards and presentation materials were created to communicate insights:

Power BI Dashboard:
- Customer segmentation overview
- High-value vs low-value customer contribution
- Segment-wise revenue analysis
- Interactive visuals for business users

Presentation (PPT):
- Business problem explanation
- Workflow and methodology
- Key insights and outcomes
- Final recommendations
